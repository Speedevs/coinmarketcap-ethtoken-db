description: Parachute aims to make it easy for people and businesses to use cryptocurrencies in their
  daily lives. The project started with ParJar Telegram, a social wallet that reportedly allowed people
  to instantly send crypto in group chats for free. Its next wave of products will include a multi-platform
  wallet and its very own app. Parachute aims to make crypto as easy as cash.
