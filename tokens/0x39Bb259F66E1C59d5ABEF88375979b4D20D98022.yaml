description: 'WAX describes itself as a purpose-built blockchain and protocol token designed to make e-commerce
  transactions faster, easier, and safer for all participants. The WAX Blockchain mainnet will launch
  on June 30, 2019 and will use Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) as its consensus mechanism and be fully
  backward compatible with EOS. The custom features and incentive mechanisms developed by WAX are designed
  to optimize the blockchainâ€™s usability in e-commerce, and encourage voting on guilds and proposals.

  WAX is creating a suite of blockchain-based tools upon which dApps, marketplaces, and native non-fungible
  tokens (NFTs) are built. These tools include services to support e-commerce operations such as an interactive
  block explorer, wallet, SSO and OAUTH, item creation, an RNG service, interactive item viewers, marketplace
  creation, and more. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that is reportedly fast (500
  millisecond block times), fee-less for customers, less expensive for developers, and leverages voting
  rewards to incentivize participation in the selection of block producers and proposals.'
