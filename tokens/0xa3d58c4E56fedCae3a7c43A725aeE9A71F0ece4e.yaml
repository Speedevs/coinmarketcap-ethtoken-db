description: 'Metronome aims to optimize for self-governance, reliability, and portability. Founded by
  a number of veterans in the space (e.g. Jeff Garzik, Matthew Roszak), Metronome is founded on three
  key design principles:

  - Self-governance with no undue influence from founders after initial launch and public access â€” contract
  governance starts at launch.

  - Reliability and predictability where issuance and supply are immutable

  - Portability to enable maximum decentralization, even across different blockchains'
