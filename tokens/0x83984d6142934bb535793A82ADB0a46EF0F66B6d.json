Remme Auth is a 2-click authentication solution that allows users to securely access a website without passwords. Instead, the solution uses X.509 self-signed certificates and blockchain technology. \nRemme's open source Protocol replaces centralized instances of Public Key Infrastructure with a blockchain-based Network of Trust with a view towards enhancing the security of users and their data. Remme offers a custom public blockchain with a three-layered consensus algorithm, which is programmed to make a pseudo-random selection of masternodes. Committees are formed using a reputational system which depends on the initial stake and quality of masternode work. The reputation of the masternode and a bet will influence the random chance of closing the block. Committees are re-elected for signing each block.\nRemme's open source Protocol replaces centralized instances of Public Key Infrastructure with a blockchain-based Network of Trust with a view towards enhancing the security of users and their data.
