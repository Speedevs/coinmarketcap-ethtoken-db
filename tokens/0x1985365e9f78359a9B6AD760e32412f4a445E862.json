{"address":"0x1985365e9f78359a9B6AD760e32412f4a445E862","description":"Augur (REP) is meant to harness the wisdom of the crowd through prediction markets on a protocol owned and operated by holders of the Ethereum-based Reputation token. In these markets users are said to be able to bet on the outcomes of events such as company performance, election results or even natural phenomena by purchasing shares that would either support or refute the proposed outcomes of such specified events. By design, the user-created markets could return fees to market participants while automating payouts using software meant to be fair, open to all, and completely decentralized.","id":1104,"links":{"Explorer":"https://etherscan.io/token/0x1985365e9f78359a9B6AD760e32412f4a445E862","Explorer
