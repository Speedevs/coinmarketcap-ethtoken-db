The protocol includes a number of designs that aim to mitigate key issues currently experienced with existing public and private blockchain protocols. It provides a smart contract engine with support for Lua and SQL and includes a number of features and frameworks such a distributed version and concurrency control. \nThe Aergo Platform proposes to provide a set of infrastructure components for enterprises and developers to host blockchain applications based on the Aergo Chain. It aims to offer a set of cloud computing execution capabilities to deploy applications such as orchestration, management, deployment, scheduling, and a comprehensive web-based interface to access its features. \nAergo is proposed as a simplified solution for developers and business users to build and deploy decentralized applications and enterprise-IT solutions using a flexible hybrid blockchain architecture as well as a serverless utility computing platform. Development for Aergo is done by the non-profit Aergo Organization, backed by Sequoia Capital China, various crypto funds, as well as the for-profit South Korea-based blockchain infrastructure provider Blocko, which is backed by Samsung Ventures and POSCO Capital.","id":3637,"links":{"Chat":"https://t.me/aergoofficial","Explorer":"https://etherscan.io/token/0xae31b85bfe62747d0836b82608b4830361a3d37a","Explorer 2":"https://ethplorer.io/address/0xae31b85bfe62747d0836b82608b4830361a3d37a","Message Board":"https://medium.com/aergo","Reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Aergo_Official","Source Code":"https://github.com/aergoio","Technical Documentation":"https://paper.aergo.io/AERGO_Whitepaper_v5.2.pdf","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/AERGO_IO","Website":"https://www.aergo.io/"},"markets":[{"exchange_name":"Bilaxy","pair":"AERGO/ETH","url":"https://bilaxy.com/exchange#symbol=136"},{"exchange_name":"BitMax","pair":"AERGO/BTC","url":"https://bitmax.io/#/trade/btc/aergo"},{"exchange_name":"BitMax","pair":"AERGO/ETH","url":"https://bitmax.io/#/trade/eth/aergo"},{"exchange_name":"BitMax","pair":"AERGO/USDT","url":"https://bitmax.io/#/trade/usdt/aergo"},{"exchange_name":"Bittrex","pair":"AERGO/BTC","url":"https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-AERGO"},{"exchange_name":"GOPAX","pair":"AERGO/BTC","url":"https://www.gopax.co.kr/exchange/aergo-btc"},{"exchange_name":"GOPAX","pair":"AERGO/ETH","url":"https://www.gopax.co.kr/exchange/aergo-eth"},{"exchange_name":"GOPAX","pair":"AERGO/KRW","url":"https://www.gopax.co.kr/exchange/aergo-krw"},{"exchange_name":"Hotbit","pair":"AERGO/BTC","url":"https://www.hotbit.io/exchange?symbol=BTC"},{"exchange_name":"Hotbit","pair":"AERGO/ETH","url":"https://www.hotbit.io/exchange?symbol=AERGO_ETH"},{"exchange_name":"IDEX","pair":"AERGO/ETH","url":"https://idex.market/eth/aergo"},{"exchange_name":"Korbit","pair":"AERGO/KRW","url":"https://www.korbit.co.kr/markets/?market=aergo-krw"},{"exchange_name":"KuCoin","pair":"AERGO/BTC","url":"https://www.kucoin.com/trade/AERGO-BTC"},{"exchange_name":"KuCoin","pair":"AERGO/ETH","url":"https://www.kucoin.com/trade/AERGO-ETH"},{"exchange_name":"Upbit","pair":"AERGO/BTC","url":"https://upbit.com/exchange?code=CRIX.UPBIT.BTC-AERGO"},{"exchange_name":"Upbit","pair":"AERGO/KRW","url":"https://upbit.com/exchange?code=CRIX.UPBIT.KRW-AERGO"}],"name":"Aergo","rank":233,"symbol":"AERGO","tags":["Token"],"website_slug":"aergo"}
