The Mobile SmartX Blockchain Platform reportedly allows users to send and receive MIB, make payments/transactions in a mobile environment. The intention is to obviate the need for costly mining-equipment such as hardware, CPU, GPU, and ASICS. The team aims to prevent the monopolization of the crypto space by specific entities and states by facilitating MIB mining on mobile devices.

Swarm's vision is to improve access to financial investment opportunities by promoting and supporting the tokenization of assets, and by providing infrastructure for free.","id":2506,"links":{"Chat":"https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@swarmfund","Explorer":"https://etherscan.io/token/0x3505f494c3f0fed0b594e01fa41dd3967645ca39","Explorer 2":"https://ethplorer.io/address/0x3505f494c3f0fed0b594e01fa41dd3967645ca39","Message Board":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2159615.0","Reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/swarm","Source Code":"https://github.com/swarmfund","Technical Documentation":"https://docs.swarm.fund/Swarm-Whitepaper-eng.pdf","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/swarm?ref_src=coinmarketcap","Website":"https://www.swarm.fund/"},"markets":[{"exchange_name":"Bitfinex","pair":"SWM/ETH","url":"https://www.bitfinex.com/t/SWM:ETH"},{"exchange_name":"Bitfinex","pair":"SWM/USD","url":"https://www.bitfinex.com/t/SWM:USD"},{"exchange_name":"HitBTC","pair":"SWM/BTC","url":"https://hitbtc.com/SWM-to-BTC"},{"exchange_name":"HitBTC","pair":"SWM/ETH","url":"https://hitbtc.com/SWM-to-ETH"},{"exchange_name":"HitBTC","pair":"SWM/USDT","url":"https://hitbtc.com/SWM-to-USDT"},{"exchange_name":"Hotbit","pair":"SWM/BTC","url":"https://www.hotbit.io/exchange?symbol=SWM_BTC"},{"exchange_name":"Hotbit","pair":"SWM/ETH","url":"https://www.hotbit.io/exchange?symbol=SWM_ETH"},{"exchange_name":"Hotbit","pair":"SWM/USDT","url":"https://www.hotbit.io/exchange?symbol=SWM_USDT"},{"exchange_name":"IDEX","pair":"SWM/ETH","url":"https://idex.market/eth/swm"}],"name":"Swarm","rank":544,"symbol":"SWM","tags":["Token"],"website_slug":"swarm-fund"},{"address":"0x3506424F91fD33084466F402d5D97f05F8e3b4AF","description":"Chiliz, powering Socios.com, aims to give sports and esports fans the ability to crowd-manage their favorite teams, games, leagues, and events.\nChiliz, powering Socios.com, aims to give sports and esports fans the ability to crowd-manage their favorite teams, games, leagues, and events.","id":4066,"links":{"Chat":"https://t.me/chiliz_io","Explorer":"https://etherscan.io/token/0x3506424f91fd33084466f402d5d97f05f8e3b4af","Explorer 2":"https://ethplorer.io/address/0x3506424f91fd33084466f402d5d97f05f8e3b4af","Explorer 3":"https://explorer.binance.org/asset/CHZ-ECD","Message Board":"https://medium.com/chiliz","Twitter":"https://twitter.com/chiliz?ref_src=coinmarketcap","Website":"https://www.chiliz.com/"},"markets":[{"exchange_name":"Bilaxy","pair":"CHZ/ETH","url":"https://bilaxy.com/exchange"},{"exchange_name":"Binance DEX","pair":"CHZ/BNB","url":"https://www.binance.org/en/trade/CHZ-ECD_BNB"},{"exchange_name":"Binance","pair":"CHZ/BNB","url":"https://www.binance.com/en/trade/CHZ_BNB"},{"exchange_name":"Binance","pair":"CHZ/BTC","url":"https://www.binance.com/en/trade/CHZ_BTC"},{"exchange_name":"Binance","pair":"CHZ/USDT","url":"https://www.binance.com/en/trade/CHZ_USDT"},{"exchange_name":"BitMax","pair":"CHZ/BTC","url":"https://bitmax.io/#/trade/btc/chz"},{"exchange_name":"BitMax","pair":"CHZ/USDT","url":"https://bitmax.io/#/trade/usdt/chz"},{"exchange_name":"IDEX","pair":"CHZ/ETH","url":"https://idex.market/eth/chz"},{"exchange_name":"KuCoin","pair":"CHZ/BTC","url":"https://www.kucoin.com/trade/CHZ-BTC"}],"name":"Chiliz","rank":103,"symbol":"CHZ","tags":["Token"],"website_slug":"chiliz"},{"address":"0x3543638eD4a9006E4840B105944271Bcea15605D","description":"U Network describes itself as a decentralized content asset storage, notarization, distribution, publishing, and valuation network.

Participants on the Chainlink network are incentivized (through rewards) to provide smart contracts with access to external data feeds.

The dapp is cross-platform - available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The application allows users to generate encrypted .ufr files with embedded price data and seed them on the Upfiring network. Users earn UFR tokens in exchange for seeding and keeping files online. Seeder smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum network mediate the movement of files across the network, maintain seeder UFR balances and allow for the decryption of files when warranted.\nUpfiring\u2019s first usable dapp prototype launched on mainnet in December 2018, with their full application launching on 5 February 2019.

The ODEM platform lets qualified educators anywhere in the world create customized curriculum and educational programs that can equip students with practical knowledge. It then connects students with various educational hubs via a smart contract payment platform. The platform also allows students to submit custom curricula requests to ODEM educators for bidding, and can also provide students with more choices for housing, transportation, and other necessities.
