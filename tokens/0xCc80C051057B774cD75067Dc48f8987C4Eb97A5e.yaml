description: The fundamental purpose of Nectar (NEC) is to reward market makers for the value they create,
  in turn encouraging them to maintain market thickness and minimised spreads on the platform trading
  pairs. Loyalty points entitle holders to loyalty rewards held in the Liquidity Token Smart Contract,
  which can be redeemed (in part or in whole) through the Redeem Mechanism upon request. Loyalty points
  can be traded on a secondary market amongst white listed Ethfinex users. If no tokens are redeemed at
  the end of a 28 day cycle, the total supply of NEC will grow. Ethfinex will hold an initial supply of
  NEC which will not grow over time?â€”?as a result, the percentage ownership will gradually decrease as
  new tokens are issued and redeemed.
