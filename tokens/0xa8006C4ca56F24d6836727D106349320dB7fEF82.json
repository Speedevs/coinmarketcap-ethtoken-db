X Cloud, Internxt's first service, is described by the team as a distributed, secure, and private cloud storage service which strives to compete with services such as Dropbox, Sync, and Amazon S3.\nThrough decentralization and zero-knowledge encryption, the team aims to create an ecosystem for users to enjoy the benefits of cloud services with added security and privacy. With X Cloud, files are client-side encrypted, fragmented, and replicated in different machines across the globe. X Cloud can be accessed via its web, desktop or smartphone apps, as well as via API.\nThrough decentralization and zero-knowledge encryption, the team aims to create an ecosystem for users to enjoy the benefits of cloud services with added security and privacy.

X Cloud can be accessed via its web, desktop or smartphone apps, as well as via API.\nInternxt's token (INXT) is used as a means of payment to Hosts who participate in the X Core program. There are 629,000 INXT circulating. This supply is also INXT's max supply since no more INXT will be generated. At X Core, Hosts can earn money by hosting small pieces of encrypted files. X Cloud customers pay Hosts, directly or indirectly, with INXT. Fiat can also be used to automatically purchase INXT at market price and sent to Hosts participating in the X Core program. Internxt will eventually reserve a small % (commission) from the transactions made, which will be used to improve its products and services.\nInternxt's token (INXT) is used as a means of payment to Hosts who participate in the X Core program.
